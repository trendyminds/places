Geocode your content using Google's Place Autocomplete field

![Screenshot](resources/img/demo-loop.gif)

## Why Places?

Places solely exists to geotag your content so you may use the latitude/longitude, street, city, state, zip, etc in whatever way you choose. It's a BYOMS (bring your own mapping system) setup so that you can use the data however you'd like.

If you are looking for a more feature-complete tool that handles mapping (and much more) I'd highly recommend [Double Secret Agency's Smart Map plugin](http://plugins.craftcms.com/smart-map)

## Template Usage
Once you have data entered into your Places field type you can query it using the following syntax:

```twig
{{entry.yourField.place}}
{{entry.yourField.city}}
{{entry.yourField.state}}
{{entry.yourField.zip}}
{{entry.yourField.country}}
{{entry.yourField.lat}}
{{entry.yourField.lng}}
```
